## Making a docker for the ior test

Unsure if this is possible, but lets see if we can make a docker for the ior tests...
Running the bare metal thing for ior and mdtest both went through validation, but honestly I'm not exactly sure if they're doing things correctly.
Assuming that they are, I'm gonna base it on that and see if I can't figure out how to make it work

So I did everything in ior deployment to install ior
Then I took the resulting directory and tarred it, and downloaded it onto my local machine.
I'm gonna then put it in the docker
