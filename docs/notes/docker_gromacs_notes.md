## Working with gromacs and docker

Did the following pull

```bash
docker pull gromacs/gromacs
#Test was
docker run -it gromacs/gromacs gmx help pdb2gmx
```

Seems to be doing fine, but I'm unsure what to do with the inputs, since there's no guide for gromacs in the docs, so unsure exactly how that works
