# AKRR Installation

AKRR support two installation ways: 
1) Global installation from RPM (on CentOS system) and 
2) In-source installation from source code, for development purposes.

## Prerequisites

Prior installing AKRR, XDMoD already should be installed. The simplest way is to 
install AKRR on same host where XDMoD was installed. AKRR needs access to XDMoD 
databases and XDMoD need access to AKRR database for results ingestion.

In case of RPM installation the dependencies would be installed automatically. Some of
the dependencies are from EPEL repository. If it was not done yet add it to repo list:

```bash
# Install EPEL if needed
yum -y install epel-release
```

The following dependencies are needed to be installed for in-source installation on CentOS:
 
```bash
# Install dependencies
yum -y install python34 python34-libs python34-bottle python34-requests \
    python34-mysql python34-typing openssl openssh-clients crontabs
```

If AKRR will use MariaDB/MySQL on the local machine install it:
```bash 
yum -y install mariadb-server  
```

## Installation on Same Host as XDMoD
### RPM Installation

Download in install AKRR RPM
```bash
sudo yum install akrr-{{ page.sw_version }}-1.noarch.rpm
```

### In Source Installation

Download tar.gz archive and uncompress it in desired installation location:
```bash
tar zxvf akrr-{{ page.sw_version }}.tar.gz
``` 

You can add bin directory from AKRR to you PATH environment variable or 
call AKRR commands with full pathname.

## Configuration
During this step AKRR will be configured and AKRR daemon will be started. 
In more details the setup script creates AKRR databases, sets new user for 
accessing these databases, creates self-signed SSL certificate for AKRR 
REST API (AKRR REST API used only internally for communication between AKRR 
and OpenXDMoD),  creates and populates AKRR database tables, followed by 
first start of AKRR daemon and creation of cronjobs for periodic log rotation 
and AKRR daemon status check.

Execute the akrr CLI with setup command. Provide the required information 
when prompted 
(the database user names / passwords):

```bash
akrr setup
```


Example of output from `akrr setup` execution:
