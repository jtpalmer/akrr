## Notes on Docker container with hpcc to work

- Well, I can't really find an hpcc (high performance compute challenge) image online anywhere, perhaps have to install hpcc from scratch? 
	- most hpcc images are about "High Performance Compute Clusters"

- Update: will be doing akrr hpcc test on ub-hpc, somehow compile things and then ultimately the goal is to get them in our own docker container so we can use it there
